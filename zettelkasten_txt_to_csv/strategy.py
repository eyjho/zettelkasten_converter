Implmenting strategy pattern

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern. It enables an algorithm's behavior to
be selected at runtime. We can implement it by creating a common (abstract)
interface and subclassing it with a new class for each strategy, how it's done
in [1], or by creating a single class and replacing a method of that class with
a different function, how it's done in [2]. The latter implementation is
possible because in Python functions are first class objects.
